Description: cosmiq is a tool for the preprocessing of liquid- or gas -
        chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS/GCMS) data with a focus
        on metabolomics or lipidomics applications. To improve the
        detection of low abundant signals, cosmiq generates master maps
        of the mZ/RT space from all acquired runs before a peak
        detection algorithm is applied. The result is a more robust
        identification and quantification of low-intensity MS signals
        compared to conventional approaches where peak picking is
        performed in each LCMS/GCMS file separately. The cosmiq package
        builds on the xcmsSet object structure and can be therefore
        integrated well with the package xcms as an alternative
        preprocessing step.
